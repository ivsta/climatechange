# CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION IN EUROPE

Data: ‘EEA database on greenhouse gas policies and measures in Europe’; 
European Environment Agency, last updated 2021 


RQ: 
What makes some climate change mitigation policies and measures (PaMs) more successful than others in GHG (greenhouse gases) emission reductions in Europe?

Secondary questions:	
-How do different PaMs characteristics vary?
-What is common type of policy instruments used?
-How does the relatedness to a Union policy explain variations in success? 
-How does the relatedness to an Air pollution policy explain variations in success?




Overview: 30 countries, 2306 observations, 76 variables

Countries with the highest number of PaMs (policies and measures) implemented, adopted or planned are:
Belgium, France, Slovenia, Spain and Croatia

The highest number of PaMs, thus far, are implemented in 2021, followed by 2014 and 2019.

1. Entities responsible for the implementation of the PaMs are usually National governments.

2. Sectors affected by most of the PaMs are: Transport, Energy Consumption and Energy Supply.

3. The types of policy instruments used are usually: Economic, Regulatory and Fiscal.

4. Unique objectives of most interventions include: Efficiency improvements of buildings (energy consumption)  and Increase in renewable energy sources in the electricity sector (energy supply)

Higher total GHG emission reductions take time, though it might require less in future.

To expect such high total GHG emission reductions per reported year, these countries must be doing something right: 
Germany, Romania, Italy, Poland and Spain

General Conclusions:
--------------------

*Most of the successful policies and measures are related to a union policy and air pollution policy, 
affecting generally the Transport and Energy sectors, and implemented by national governments

*The most common type of policy instruments are Economic and Regulatory
