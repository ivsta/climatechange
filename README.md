RQ: 
What makes some climate change mitigation policies and measures (PaMs) more successful than others in GHG (greenhouse gases) emission reductions in Europe?

Secondary questions:	
-How do different PaMs characteristics vary?
-What is common type of policy instruments used?
-How does the relatedness to a Union policy explain variations in success? 
-How does the relatedness to an Air pollution policy explain variations in success?
